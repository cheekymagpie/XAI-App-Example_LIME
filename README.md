# XAI-App-Example_LIME

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of Explainable AI (XAI) using the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) framework. 
The script uses the finBERT model, a BERT-based model finetuned for financial sentiment analysis, to classify user-provided text as positive, neutral, or negative. 
It then uses LIME to generate an explanation for the classification, identifying which parts of the input text contribute most to the model’s prediction. 
The script includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to enter their text and view the model’s output and LIME explanation. 
It also includes a feature that stops the script if it runs for longer than a set amount of time without producing a result, preventing excessive resource usage on weaker devices. 
The GUI displays a graphical representation of the LIME explanation, showing how much each word in the input text contributes to the model’s classification. 
This project serves as a practical and approachable example of XAI in action.

This project's code is written with AI assistance from GPT-4 via Bing/Copilot.
